The best way to learn Python tutorial series notebooks
======================================================

These are the notebooks accompanying `the best way to learn Python
tutorial series on YouTube <http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwNU7Gk6Z5ZkXXsvtJTtBhQNl905Jua-O>`_.

This tutorial series is different, for two reasons: First, we use
the `IPython Notebook <http://ipython.org/>`_, which is probably
the ideal way to experiment with and learn Python. Second, it
makes use of `Anaconda by Continuum IO
<http://www.continuum.io/downloads>`_, meaning installation on all
platforms is easy, you have a Python environment completely
separate from your system Python, and you have access to bunches
of scientific, mathematical and graphing libraries.
