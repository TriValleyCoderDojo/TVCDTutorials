## A Beginner's Python Tutorial

When CivilizationTM IV (Firaxis Games, published by Take2) was announced, one of the most exciting features was that much of the scripting code will be in python, and the game data in XML. This tutorial attempts to teach you the basics of python programming that you could use with civIV.

Of course, this tutorial is not limited to those who want to play a slow-paced turn-based strategy game. That is what it was written for, but is perfectly useful to any person with **no programming knowledge at all**, who wants to learn python. But what makes this tutorial unique, is that it is written for beginners, by a beginner.

<div align="center">

<div align="center" class="CodeTitle">Table 1 - Lessons</div>

<table class="TableBody">

<tbody>

<tr>

<td class="TableContent" width="30%">**Number**</td>

<td class="TableContent" width="70%">**Name**</td>

</tr>

<tr>

<td class="TableContent" width="%s">

Then we also have the (to be written) Civilization IV python introduction. It will begin its release in early November.

Here lies my beloved Python tutorial. It has been published, source and all, so
that it might *finally* be fully corrected/updated/relevant.

While I have previously guarded 'ownership' of the tutorial (and, according to
the LICENSE, I am still the copyright holder), the fact is that the wider
software community can be a much better custodian of its content than can I.

I still intend on hosting this tutorial on http://sthurlow.com/python/ - it
ain't going anywhere. Re-skins/corrections/expansions might all be uploaded. It
is currently MIT (see LICENSE.mit) and Creative Commons Attribution Australia
(see LICENSE.cc-by) licensed - take your pick.

So. It has come to this. Fork me, biatches!

##FAQ

###Your code is awful and you suck.

That's not a question, but okay. I acknowledge that this code is awful, and as
a high school kid learning programming, I sucked at many things. But that's
where you can help! You could help fix one of many things:

* The styling
* The code formatting
* The absent DOCTYPE
* The strange XML-ish intermediary format
* The typographical errors
* The missing content
* The sometimes awkward phrases (though this is supposed to be *fun*, y'know)

###What can I do to it?

Whatever you want, within the License.

###What are you going to do?

I will continue to host the site. I will obviously security review the code
before publishing. I may contribute to any of the aforementioned things that
need fixing. However, it's been years (and dozens of ignored emails) since
I've touched this, so if yesterday's weather holds true, well, you know what
to expect.
