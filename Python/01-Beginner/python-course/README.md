The programming language [Python](http://www.python.org) is widely used within many scientific domains nowadays and the language is readily accessible to scholars from the Humanities. Python is an excellent choice for dealing with (linguistic as well as literary) textual data, which is so typical of the Humanities. In this book you will be thoroughly introduced to the language and be taught to program basic algorithmic procedures. The book expects no prior experience with programming, although we hope to provide some interesting insights and skills for more advanced programmers as well. The book consists of 4 chapters. 

- [Chapter 1](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.githubusercontent.com/TriValleyCoderDojo/TVCDTutorials/master/Python/01-Beginner/python-course/Chapter%201%20-%20Getting%20started.ipynb) starts with the very basics where we will try to whet your appetite. You will be asked to do many short quizes to test whether you really understand the material.
- [Chapter 2](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.githubusercontent.com/TriValleyCoderDojo/TVCDTutorials/master/Python/01-Beginner/python-course/Chapter%202%20-%20First%20steps.ipynb) will introduce you to the task of text processing. You will learn how to read files from 
 your computer, how to clean them and compute a frequency distribution over words. 
- [Chapter 3](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.githubusercontent.com/TriValleyCoderDojo/TVCDTutorials/master/Python/01-Beginner/python-course/Chapter%203%20-%20Text%20analysis.ipynb) deals with preprocessing text. You will learn some of the elementary tools to analyse your data. 
- [Chapter 4](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.githubusercontent.com/TriValleyCoderDojo/TVCDTutorials/master/Python/01-Beginner/python-course/Chapter%204%20-%20Programming%20principles.ipynb) is a more theoretical chapter that explains to you some of the basic programming principles, common practices and where to find documentation. 

This document describes the installation procedure for all the software needed for the Python class. If your stuck anywhere in the installation procedure, please do not hesitate to contact Folgert Karsdorp (folgert.karsdorp@meertens.knaw.nl).

## Sublime text

We advice you to install a good text editor, Sublime text 2 for example. However, you are absolutely free to use your own favorite editor. For Sublime Text 2 go to http://www.sublimetext.com/ download the version for your operating system and install.

In the course we will be using software that works best with Google Chrome. Firefox 6 (or above) and Safari will also work. Internet Explorer is not supported. 

We will be using Python 3 for our course. Lower versions are more or less supported, but not recommended.
