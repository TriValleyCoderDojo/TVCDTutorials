ComputerCraftEdu Starter World
==============================

This is starter world that will help you gain the skills you need to be able to be able to use the Turtlebots.  It will run through a set of challenges that help you learn how to do the things you will need to do. It is understandable that you might be anxious to try programming your Turtlebot right away, but it is highly recommended that you take the time to go through the challenges and develop the core skills that you will need. If later on you ask for a mentor’s help and it is one of the core skills that you could have learned in the starter world, the mentor may ask you to go back to the start world and complete these challenges first.  

1. Have Minecraft installed with a valid account, install the FML and ComputerCraftEdu Mod

2. Download the file, compCraftStarter.zip, found in this directory.

3. You will need to copy this file into the saves directory, which is under your Minecraft home directory. If you don’t know where the Minecraft Home directory is

  * On Windows, open a command window, and type “cd %appdata%\.minecraft
  * On Mac, open a command window, and type “cd ~/Library/Application?Support/minecraft”

  If neither of these work for you, Google is your friend.

4. You will then need to unzip the contents of the file to extract the contents and make the world available the next time Minecraft is started.
