ComputerCraftEdu Starter World
==============================

This is starter world that will help you gain the skills you need to be able to be able to use the Turtlebots.  It will run through a set of challenges that help you learn how to do the things you will need to do. It is understandable that you might be anxious to try programming your Turtlebot right away, but it is highly recommended that you take the time to go through the challenges and develop the core skills that you will need. If later on you ask for a mentor’s help and it is one of the core skills that you could have learned in the starter world, the mentor may ask you to go back to the start world and complete these challenges first.
