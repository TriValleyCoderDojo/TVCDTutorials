ComputerCraftEdu Installation
=============================

In order to use ComputerCraftEdu, you will need to install the ForgeModLoader (known as FML), which will allow you to Forge Mods, and you will need to install the ComputerCraftEdu Mod.  You need to use the specific version of 1.7.10 for now.  Both of the jars are included for your convenience.  

1. You will need to have a completely install Minecraft launcher and a valid Minecraft account

2. Download the two jars from this directory

3. Execute the FML installer, forge-1.7.10-10.13.3.1428-1.7.10-installer.jar.  You should be able to double click on it, or you can open a command window and use the command “java -jar <file>”

  1. Be sure to select “Install Client” option when prompted

  2. After the installation is complete, run the Minecraft launch and ensure the Forge profile runs correctly and creates the needed folders.  Note: There are some computers that will not support Forge. Hopefully, you don’t have one of those

4. Now you will need copy the ComputerCraftPlusComputerCraftEdu1.74pr19.jar file in the Minecraft mods directory. If you don’t know where it is

  * On Windows, open a command window, and type “cd %appdata%\.minecraft
  * On Mac, open a command window, and type “cd ~/Library/Application?Support/minecraft”

  If neither of these work for you, Google is your friend.

  Then you will need to copy the jar file into the mods directory.  If there is no mods, then it means, either FML did not install or you did not launch Minecraft with the Forge profile.
