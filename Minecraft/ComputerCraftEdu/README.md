ComputerCraftEdu
================

ComputerCraftEdu is an easy way to get started with ComputerCraft.  So what is ComputerCraft, you may ask, and that is a fair question. ComputerCraft is a mod to Minecraft that lets you create robots, that look kind of like turtles, and are called Turtlebots.  You can then program the Turtlebots to do just about anything that you can when playing Minecraft.  You can have them mine for you, cut down trees, build houses, just about anything you can think up.  

Now ComputerCraft does its programming in a text based language called Lua, and it can be a bit daunting for beginners, so ComputerCraftEdu is another mod, that uses ComputerCraft, but adds an easy to use Graphical User Interface (GUI), which makes it easier to get used to Turtlebot programming and work your way up to full-blown ComputerCraft with Lua.
