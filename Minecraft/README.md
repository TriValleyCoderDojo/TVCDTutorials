Minecraft
=========

Minecraft is a lot fun!  But Minecraft can also be a great way to start learning about programming.

TriValleyCoderDojo has gathered some info to help you get started

1. [Minecraft Jar Hacking](https://github.com/TriValleyCoderDojo/Minecraft-Jar-Hacks) - here you can go into Minecraft and "hack" the original code to make Minecraft do slightly different things.  For example, making a snowball explode when it hits something.  Unfortunately, you can only do this for version 1.6.4, due changes made to the development environment.  

2. [Minecraft Modding](http://www.lopakalogic.com/articles/minecraft-articles/minecraft-mods-forge/) - here you can learn to make your own pluggable Minecraft Mod and then be able to share it with your friends.

3. [ComputerCraftEdu](https://github.com/TriValleyCoderDojo/TVCDTutorials/tree/master/Minecraft/ComputerCraftEdu) - here you can learn to program Turtlebots to do some of the things that you need to do by hand in Minecraft, such as mining, digging, farming, etc...  The nice thing about ComputerCraftEdu is that it gives you a graphical interface to make things easier to get started before moving on to the more powerful ComputerCraft.

4. ComputerCraft - here you can do more advanced programming of Turtlebots.  Be warned this is all text based using the Lua programming language, so if you are not used to typing code, you might want to start with ComputerCraftEdu.
