Computecraft
============

ComputerCraft is the next level in playing Minecraft.  It will allow you to program Turtlebots to do alot of the usual tasks in Minecraft, such as mining, cutting down trees, building houses, etc...

A really good place to get started with ComputerCraft would be to follow a Tutorial put together by Joe Dean
