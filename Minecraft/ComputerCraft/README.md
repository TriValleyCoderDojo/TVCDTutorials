Computecraft
============

ComputerCraft is the next level in playing Minecraft.  It will allow you to program Turtlebots to do alot of the usual tasks in Minecraft, such as mining, cutting down trees, building houses, etc...

Before you begin, you will need to have installed ForgeModLoader and the Mod, if you have not you can use [ComputerCraft Installation](https://github.com/TriValleyCoderDojo/TVCDTutorials/tree/master/Minecraft/ComputerCraftEdu/install)

A really good place to get started with ComputerCraft would be to follow the Tutorials put together by Lua Liquidator

If you are having some trouble coming up with Lua code from your Turtle, then you might be able to use some code that someone else has already written to get some ideas.
