## Sub-Lessons

  * [Lesson 1](https://github.com/CoderDojoSF/git-and-github/blob/master/lesson1)

## Pre-reqs

The only pre-requisites for this class are a working copy of Git and an account on [GitHub](https://github.com). You can
signup for a GitHub account [for free on the signup page](https://github.com/signup/free).

We will want to check that our copy of Git is at least 1.7.10 or higher. We can do this by typing into
a terminal window:

    git --version

If your version is lower than 1.7.10 or you do not have Git installed, continue with the appropriate
installation steps for your system.


#### Git on Windows

On windows, one of the easiest ways to use Git is to [download the GitHub client](http://windows.github.com). This
will install Git Bash along with the GitHub for Windows client. A shortcut to Git Bash should be on your desktop once
the install finishes.

#### Mac OSX

By default, Macs come with Git already installed. If you need to update your version, you can download
a newer version at [git-scm](http://git-scm.com).
