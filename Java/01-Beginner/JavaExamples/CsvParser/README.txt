This program parses a CSV (comma-separated values) file and stores the information in two ArrayList objects. The first ArrayList stores the column names (if present). The second ArrayList stores the records. This program takes two parameters: [full path filename] [true|false header present].

A sample input file, called addresses.csv, is included.

Here is a sample run:
