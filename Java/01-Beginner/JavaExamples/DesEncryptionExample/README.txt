The MyEncrypt and MyDecrypt Java programs work together to encrypt and decrypt files. DES encryption is used, with DES/ECB/PKCS5Padding options.

MyEncrypt accepts a file and a password. It encrypts the data and stores it in a binary file called encrypt.bin.

MyDecrypt accepts a file generated by MyEncrypt, along with the password used by MyEncrypt. It decrypts the data and writes it to a binary file called decrypt.bin.

Here is a sample run of the two programs:

C:\Temp> java MyEncrypt oranges.jpg mypa$$99
file written: encrypt.bin

C:\Temp> java MyDecrypt encrypt.bin mypa$$99
file written: decrypt.bin

C:\Temp> rename decrypt.bin oranges2.jpg

C:\Temp>
